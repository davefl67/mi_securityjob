Since most of you fuckers don't read, let me make this as simple as simple can be.

*I offer this repo to the world as a **courtesy**. I forked it before the original author dropped off the planet and the repo went 404 and was lost. I'm neither a developer nor a programmer. I do not offer support for this repo.*

Don't contact me on GitHub, Discord, or via any other medium for support for MIAgimir's resources. You may [reach them here](https://github.com/Mesa-Indigo).
